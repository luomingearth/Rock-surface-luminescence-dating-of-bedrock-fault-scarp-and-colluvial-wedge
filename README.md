Dears users,

Here the explanation to use these matlab codes in the code files named "Code_Huashan_Fault".

code : "fitting_no_erosion_FOK"
--> Assuming no erosion, the OSL-DPs of individual samples were fitted using the FOM to obtain the depth of half saturation (DHS) and grouping.

code : "fitting_no_erosion_GOK_r1_9"
--> Assuming no erosion, the OSL-DPs of individual samples were fitted using the GOM (r=1.9) to obtain DHS and grouping.

code "fitting_uderground_GOK_r1_9"
--> The OSL-DPs of subsurface samples were fitted with the GOM (r=1.9) to obtain the DHS and grouping.

code "get_t_groups_erosion_corr_GOK_r1"
--> The OSL-DPs corrected for erosion were fitted with the GOM (r=1)  to determine the exposure ages of samples from different episodes.

code "get_t_groups_erosion_corr_GOK_r1_9"
--> The OSL-DPs corrected for erosion were fitted with the GOM (r=1.9) to determine the exposure ages of samples from different episodes.

code "fitting_and_simulate_XJ57"
--> We fitted the XJ57 sample with the two-exposure-one-burial formula and simulated its OSL-DP through the first exposure, exposure-burial, and exposure-burial-reexposure stages.

code "simulate_fault_and_colluvial"
--> Simulate the OSL-DPs of the bedrock fault plane after two seismic events, under the conditions of being uncovered, having been covered, and currently being covered by colluvial wedges.

The text data shows the OSL-depth actually measured.

In addition, the binx files named "Exposure_and_Burial_Dating_Binx_Files", which were used for the exposure and burial dating of the bedrock fault plane samples from the western section of the Huashan Fault, have also been uploaded. This is accompanied by an Excel file named "Relationship between Slices No. and Binx Position". This file is used to determine the correspondence between the rock slice numbers and their respective positions in the binx files, and it also contains the resultant processed data.
